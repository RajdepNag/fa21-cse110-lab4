4. There is an error is line 13 because the variable result is not defined. Result is a 'let' variable and its scope is only its block. the console call in line 13 is outside the block in which result was defined and hence gives an error.
5. The code returns an error at line 5 because you cannot assign anything to a 'const' variable once it's initialized. Therefore the code will print neither of the output statements because result cannot be reassigned sum1 + sum2.
